# reverse polish notation 
I read a litle about it and decided to write a quick cli in rust to practice the notation and my rust abilities.

## how to run 
you need the rust ambient instaled
then run 
```bash
cargo run '{notation}'
```
and it should show you the answer, replace {notation} with the notation, 
notation example: 123*+4-
